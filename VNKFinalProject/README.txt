The project is built using maven in order to handle the dependency on TomP2P version 4.4.

A compiled version of the program is provided in this directory named "VNKP2P.jar". This already has the dependencies packed
into the jar.
The jar file can be run through the bat file called startup.bat or by running the jar file through the command line.
The jar file can be run on command line with the command "java -jar VNKP2P.jar".
